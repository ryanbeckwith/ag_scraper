    Summary:
        Initializes a ScraperWorker object. This instantiates a new headless Chrome window instance where future
        actions involving scraping will occur.

    Fields:
        _driver (WebDriver): The WebDriver object representing the current webpage that is being scraped. Essential to
                            nearly every operation relating to extracting information from a webpage.
        _website_address (string): The partially complete address of a listing of the A-G Course List website, requires
                                  a 3-4 digit code to be completed.
        _schools (list): A list of School objects that stores all information relevant to a school listing on the A-G
                        Course List website.
        _num_courses (list): A list containing the number of courses for each of the school course pages that were
                            scraped.
        _invalid_ids (list): Contains the website IDs of all pages that were not valid institution pages.

                                 Course object.
        _error_output (string): A summary of the errors that occurred while scraping the school course page.
        _sf (Salesforce): The Salesforce instance that corresponds to The Village Method's backend database. This field
                          sources authentication information (username, password, security token) from environment
                          variables, which must be set appropriately before running this scraper.
        _NAMESPACE: The UUID namespace which Course external ID fields use to determine their UUIDs. This field is
                    dynamically set in the _parse_school method based on the website URL.
